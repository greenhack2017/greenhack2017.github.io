        <h2>What is <br /> <span class="smaller-heading">a Change Maker?</span></h2>
      </div>
      <div class="section-content">
        <blockquote>Changemaker (n) â€“ A term coined by the social entrepreneurship organization, one who desires change in the world and, by Ashoka, meaning gathering knowledge and resources, change happen.</blockquote>
        <p>Changemakers share the same basic motives as business entrepreneurs: achieving a change that will not only help the state of man, but reach as many people as possible.</p>
        <p>There is one main difference between changemakers and the rest of the world. Most people desire change; many know what they would like to see different in the world, and some even know how it could be done best. There is a higher class of people who act to see their change happen; many of these fail. However, this is where changemakers differ: they make their change happen. Using a combination of knowledge, resources, and determination, they push through until their dream becomes truth, and then push
        some more. Changemakers are the force of social evolution; everyone can become one, and everyone should.</p>
